# Getting Started with Hardhat on Flamma Network

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that helps developers compile, deploy, test, and debug their Ethereum applications. This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Hardhat project on Flamma network.

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Step 2: Create a New Project

Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project. Navigate to the directory and initialize a new Node.js project.

``` js copy
mkdir my-hardhat-project
cd my-hardhat-project
npm init -y
```

## Step 3: Install Hardhat

Install Hardhat in your project directory.

``` js copy
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

## Step 4: Create a Hardhat Project

Run the following command to create a new Hardhat project. Choose "Create a basic sample project" and follow the prompts.

``` js copy
npx hardhat
```

## Step 5: Project Structure

After creating the project, your directory should look something like this:

```
my-hardhat-project/
├── contracts/
│   └── Greeter.sol
├── scripts/
│   └── sample-script.js
├── test/
│   └── sample-test.js
├── hardhat.config.js
├── package.json
└── node_modules/
```

## Step 6: Configure Flamma Network

Edit your `hardhat.config.js` to add the Flamma network configuration. You'll need the Flamma network RPC URL and a private key.

``` js copy
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    flamma: {
      url: "https://rpc.flamma.network", // Replace with the actual Flamma network RPC URL
      accounts: ["0x..."] // Replace with your private key
    }
  }
};
```

## Step 7: Compile Contracts

To compile your smart contracts, run:

``` js copy
npx hardhat compile
```

## Step 8: Deploy Contracts to Flamma Network

Create a deployment script in the `scripts` folder, for example, `deploy.js`:

``` js copy
async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

  const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory("Greeter");
  const greeter = await Greeter.deploy("Hello, Hardhat!");

  console.log("Greeter deployed to:", greeter.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Run the deployment script:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network flamma
```

## Step 9: Testing Contracts

Hardhat uses Mocha and Chai for testing. Edit the sample test file or create a new one in the `test` folder:

``` js copy
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Greeter", function () {
  it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function () {
    const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory("Greeter");
    const greeter = await Greeter.deploy("Hello, world!");
    await greeter.deployed();

    expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hello, world!");

    await greeter.setGreeting("Hola, mundo!");
    expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hola, mundo!");
  });
});
```

Run the tests:

```
npx hardhat test
```

By following these steps, you should have a basic Hardhat project set up with compiled, deployed, and tested smart contracts on the Flamma network. For more advanced usage and features, refer to the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview).
