# Getting Started with Truffle for EVM Development on the Flamma Network

Truffle is a popular development framework for Ethereum, offering a suite of tools for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts. This tutorial will guide you through setting up a project with Truffle and deploying a simple ERC20 token contract on the Flamma network.

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Step 2: Install Truffle and Ganache

Open your terminal and install Truffle globally using npm:

``` js copy
npm install -g truffle
```

Install Ganache, a personal blockchain for local development and testing:

``` js copy
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

## Step 3: Create a New Truffle Project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it. Then, initialize a new Truffle project:

``` js copy
mkdir my-truffle-project
cd my-truffle-project
truffle init
```

Your project directory should now look like this:

```
my-truffle-project/
├── contracts/
│   ├── Migrations.sol
├── migrations/
│   └── 1_initial_migration.js
├── test/
├── truffle-config.js
```

## Step 4: Create an ERC20 Token Contract

In the `contracts` folder, create a new file named MyToken.sol and add the following code:

``` js copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```
This contract creates a simple ERC20 token named "MyToken" with the symbol "MTK".

## Step 5: Create a Migration Script

In the `migrations` folder, create a new file named `2_deploy_contracts.js` and add the following code:

``` js copy
const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(MyToken, 1000000);
};
```
This script will deploy the MyToken contract with an initial supply of 1,000,000 tokens.

## Step 6: Start Ganache

Start Ganache to create a local blockchain for development:

``` js copy
ganache-cli
```

## Step 7: Configure Truffle for Flamma Network

Edit the `truffle-config.js` file to configure the development network and the Flamma network. Add the following code:

``` js copy
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*", // Match any network id
    },
    flamma: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(process.env.MNEMONIC, "https://rpc.flamma.network"),
      network_id: "FLAMMA_NETWORK_ID", // Replace with the actual Flamma network ID
      gas: 5500000,
      confirmations: 2,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    }
  },
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.8.0", // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)
    },
  },
};
```
Replace "FLAMMA_NETWORK_ID" with the actual network ID of the Flamma network.

## Step 8: Compile Contracts

To compile your smart contracts, run:

``` js copy
truffle compile
```
## Step 9: Deploy Contracts

To deploy your contracts to the local Ganache blockchain, run:

``` js copy
truffle migrate
```

To deploy your contracts to the Flamma network, run:

``` js copy
truffle migrate --network flamma
```

## Step 10: Interact with Your Token

You can interact with your deployed contract using the Truffle console. Open the console by running:

``` js copy
truffle console --network flamma
```

In the console, run the following commands:

``` js copy
const token = await MyToken.deployed();
const balance = await token.balanceOf(web3.eth.accounts[0]);
console.log(balance.toString());
```

## Step 11: Testing Contracts

Create a new file in the `test` folder named `MyToken.test.js` and add the following code to write a simple test:

``` js copy
const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

contract("MyToken", (accounts) => {
  it("should put 1000000 MyToken in the first account", async () => {
    const tokenInstance = await MyToken.deployed();
    const balance = await tokenInstance.balanceOf(accounts[0]);
    assert.equal(balance.valueOf(), 1000000, "1000000 wasn't in the first account");
  });
});
```

Run the test:

``` js copy
truffle test
```

By following these steps, you should have a basic ERC20 token contract created with OpenZeppelin, compiled, deployed, and tested using Truffle on both a local blockchain and the Flamma network.
