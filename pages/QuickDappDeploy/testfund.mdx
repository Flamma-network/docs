# Get $FLA Test Funds

**The Flamma Testnet Faucet** is a tool designed to provide developers and users with free test tokens on the Flamma Testnet. These test tokens are essential for experimenting with and testing the functionalities of the Flamma Network without the need for real FLA tokens. The faucet helps in creating a robust testing environment where users can deploy and interact with smart contracts, simulate transactions, and explore the network's features without financial risk.

## 1. Access the Faucet

Open your web browser and navigate to the [Faucet](https://flafaucet.dev/).
