# Deploying a "Hello, Flamma!" Smart Contract Using Remix IDE on Flamma Network

Remix IDE is a powerful and accessible web-based development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. This tutorial will guide you through quickly writing, compiling, and deploying a "Hello, Flamma!" Solidity smart contract using Remix IDE, with an additional focus on deploying to the Flamma network.

## Step 1: Open Remix IDE

Open your web browser and navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Remix IDE is a web-based platform, so no installation is required.

## Step 2: Create a New File

In the Remix IDE, create a new file. Name your file `MyContract.sol`.

## Step 3: Write the Smart Contract

Copy and paste the following Solidity code into `MyContract.sol`:

This contract allows you to set and get a greeting message.

``` js copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    string public greeting;

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    function getGreeting() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Compile the Smart Contract

Switch to the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the left sidebar. Select the appropriate compiler version (e.g., 0.8.20) that matches the pragma version specified in your Solidity file. Then, click the "Compile MyContract.sol" button.

## Step 5: Deploy the Smart Contract on the Flamma Network

To deploy your contract on the Flamma network, you will need to use MetaMask, a browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts.

1. **Install MetaMask:** 

If you don't have MetaMask installed, you can download it from MetaMask.

2. **Connect to Flamma Network:** 

Open MetaMask, click on the network dropdown, and select "Custom RPC". Enter the following details:

- Network Name: FLA testnet
- New RPC URL: https://rpc.flamma.network
- Chain ID: 6550
- Symbol: FLA
- Block Explorer URL: (Optional)

  **Add Funds to MetaMask:** Ensure your MetaMask wallet has enough funds (FLA) to deploy the contract. No FLA? Go to [faucet](https://flafaucet.dev/)
</Callout>



3. **Deploy Using Remix:**

- Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix.
- Select "Injected Web3" as the environment. This will connect Remix to MetaMask.
- Make sure your contract is selected in the "Contract" dropdown.
- Enter a greeting message (e.g., "Hello, Flamma!") in the constructor arguments field.
- Click the "Deploy" button.

MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Once confirmed, your contract will be deployed on the Flamma network.

## Step 6: Interact with the Deployed Contract

After deploying the contract, you can interact with it directly from Remix:

Here is your contract address.

1. Select Deployed Contract: In the "Deployed Contracts" section, you should see your deployed `MyContract` instance.

2. Get Greeting: Click on the `getGreeting` button to read the greeting message from the contract.

3. Set Greeting: Enter a new greeting message in the `setGreeting` input field and click the `setGreeting` button to update the message. MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction.
