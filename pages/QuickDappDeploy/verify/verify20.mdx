# Detailed Guide to Verify the "LaughCoin" ERC-20 Smart Contract on flascan

This guide will walk you through the process of verifying the "LaughCoin" ERC-20 smart contract on flascan, using the example contract that was previously deployed. Verifying your contract ensures transparency and allows others to view the source code and interact with the contract.

## Prerequisites

1. Remix IDE: Your contract should be deployed via Remix IDE.

2. Source Code: Your smart contract source code and its dependencies. (e.g., `LaughCoin`, `LOL`, `0xFd764C240Afcb7643B9a8c6CD42682425DEAd89F`)

3. Flascan: https://testnet.flascan.net.

> If you have not already deployed the contract, please refer to the instructions provided [Create an ERC-20 token](/QuickDappDeploy/erc20.mdx).

## Step 1: Get Contract Details

Enter `LaughCoin` contract address `0xFd764C240Afcb7643B9a8c6CD42682425DEAd89F`.

Click "At Address" to interact with the already deployed contract.

## Step 2: Flatten the Contracts
Go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. Right-click on the `erc20.sol` file in the Remix file explorer.
2. Select "Flatten" from the context menu.

3. Remix will generate a flattened version of the contract `erc20_flattened.sol` and open it in a new file.

## Step 3: Start Verification on flascan

1. Go to contract [LaughCoin](https://testnet.flascan.net/address/0xFd764C240Afcb7643B9a8c6CD42682425DEAd89F?tab=contract).

2. On the contract page, click on the ‚ÄúVerify & Publish‚Äù button.

3. Enter Verification Details:

- **Contract license**

    Select "No License"

- **Verification method**

    Solidity (Flattened source code)

- **Compiler**

    v0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a

- **EVM Version**

    paris

- **Optimization enabled**

    200

- **Contract code**

    Copy and paste `sunflower_flattened.sol`.

- **Verify & Publish**

    Submit your contract for verification.

The page should be like:

## Step 4: Verification Status

- **Wait for Verification:**

    Wait for Blockscout to process the verification.

    If successful, your contract source code and ABI will be publicly available on flascan.

- **Troubleshooting:**

    If verification fails, check for common issues such as mismatched compiler versions, incorrect optimization settings, or incorrectly entered constructor arguments.
