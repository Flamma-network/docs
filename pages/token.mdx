# Flamma (FLA) Token

FLA is the native cryptocurrency of the Flamma network, similar to how Ether functions in the Ethereum ecosystem. Users need FLA tokens to interact with the Flamma network, as they are required to pay for gas fees associated with transactions and smart contract interactions. Additionally, FLA tokens play a crucial role in the networkâ€™s security model through staking, where users can lock up their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards.

## Tokenomics
FLA is the essential resource within the FLAMMA NETWORK ecosystem, with a capped supply of 1.2 billion tokens. This supply cap is designed to ensure the stability of the token's value and prevent inflation. These tokens power the network by enabling staking and daily operations, such as initiating transactions, thereby securing the ecosystem.

In the FLAMMA network, FLA determines the weight of each node in network decisions. Validators receive voting power proportional to their staked FLA, according to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. To execute transactions on the network, users must pay "gas" fees, which are burned, permanently removing them from the circulating supply.

At the genesis, 1 billion FLA tokens were minted. Additional FLA tokens are continuously minted in small amounts to reward validators for their positive contributions, with rewards issued at the end of their staking period. This minting process offsets the FLA burned through transaction fees, with the total supply expected to reach 1.2 billion over approximately five years.

1 billion FLA distributed as follows:

- **40% Participants & Contributors (SureAirdrop Part1):** 400 million FLA tokens are allocated to the SureAirdrop program to incentivize active participation and contributions to the Flamma network.

- **20% Community (Sureairdrop Part2):** 200 million FLA tokens are reserved for community rewards, ensuring continuous engagement and growth within the Flamma community.

- **25% Eco Grants:** 250 million FLA tokens for ecosystem development. Projects that receive grants typically have a lock-up period of 1 to 3 years.

- **15% Governance:** 150 million FLA tokens are set aside for governance purposes, with a lock-up period of 3 years.

FLAMMA does not slash validators' staked tokens for negligence or malicious behavior. However, such actions are discouraged as they result in wasted computing resources without any rewards, thus protecting the network's integrity.
