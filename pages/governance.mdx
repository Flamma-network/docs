# Overview of Governance

Governance on the Flamma Network empowers stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes that shape the network's future. This decentralized approach ensures the community has a voice in key decisions, maintaining the network's integrity and alignment with its participants' interests.

## Proposal Process

1. Proposal Submission: Any user can submit a proposal by paying a deposit.
2. Deposit Period: The community can add deposits to the proposal to meet the minimum threshold.
3. Voting Period: Stakeholders vote on the proposal.
4. Result Period: Votes are tallied and the outcome is determined.

## Voting Options

- **Yes:** Agree with the proposal.
- **No:** Disagree with the proposal.
- **No, with Veto:** Strongly disagree and request the deposit to be burned.
- **Abstain:** Neither for nor against, but still participating.

## Proposal Quorum

A minimum percentage of the total staked tokens must participate for a proposal to be valid.

## Proposal Types

- **Parameter Change Proposal:** Modify network parameters.
- **Community Pool Spend Proposal:** Allocate funds from the community pool.
- **Text Proposal:** Handle other significant decisions.
- And more...
