# Flamma Mainnet

## Flamma Mainnet Launch Plan

The launch of the Flamma Mainnet will be conducted in three comprehensive phases, each designed to ensure a smooth and successful deployment of the network. These phases are **Pre-Mainnet (Pre-MN)**, **Initial Mainnet (I-MN)**, and **Full Mainnet (F-MN)**. Below is a detailed plan describing each phase and the key activities involved.
 
<Steps>
### Pre-Mainnet (Pre-MN)
 
**Objective**: Prepare the groundwork for a successful mainnet launch by initiating reward programs, finalizing grant projects, and iterating incentive quests.

1. **SureAirdrop Part 1**:
   - **Initiate Reward Plans**: Launch the SureAirdrop reward programs to incentivize early adopters and active community members.
   - **Engagement Activities**: Encourage users to participate in community quests and level-up activities to earn FLA tokens.

2. **Grant Project Launches (Alpha Stage)**:
   - **Deploy Alpha Projects**: Release and deploy all grant-funded projects in their alpha versions.
   - **Testing and Feedback**: Conduct thorough testing of these projects and gather user feedback to refine them.

3. **Iterative Incentive quests**:
   - **SureAirdrop Part 2**: Launch the Community SureAirdrop Part 2, introducing community identities and a mod management system to assist with community growth. Additionally, open applications for ambassadors to further support and grow the community. 
   - **Partner Project Incentives**: Initiate incentive programs for partner projects to encourage collaboration and integration.
   - **Quest Iteration**: Continuously update and introduce new quests to keep the community engaged and motivated.
 
### Initial Mainnet (I-MN)

**Objective**: Transition to a fully operational alpha mainnet, ensuring proper mapping and reward distribution, and initiating essential network operations.
 
1. **Alpha Mainnet Launch**:
   - **Mapping SureAirdrop Rewards**: Begin the process of mapping SureAirdrop rewards to the mainnet.
   - **Initial Token Distribution**: Distribute initial FLA rewards to users who have completed quests and participated in the SureAirdrop.

2. **Grant Project Finalization**:
   - **Project Release**: Officially release grant projects on the mainnet.
   - **FLA Rewards and Lock-Up**: Distribute final FLA rewards to grant projects and ensure they adhere to the agreed lock-up terms.
   - **Security Audits**: Perform security audits on all projects to ensure robustness and reliability.

3. **Network Operations**:
   - **eNode Activation**: Activate eNodes to support the network’s infrastructure and ensure seamless operations.
   - **Initial Governance**: Implement initial governance structures to manage network activities and updates.

### Full Mainnet (F-MN)

**Objective**: Complete the mainnet launch with all functionalities in place, open-source all contracts, and enable FLA token circulation.

1. **Grant Project Deployment**:
   - **Final Deployment**: Officially deploy all grant projects with complete functionalities.
   - **Open-Source Contracts**: Open-source all smart contracts for transparency and community involvement.
   - **Comprehensive Testing**: Conduct extensive testing to ensure all systems are operational and secure.

2. **FLA Token Circulation**:
   - **Token Trading**: Enable FLA token trading on supported exchanges.
   - **Market Integration**: Integrate FLA into various market platforms to enhance liquidity and user access.

3. **Mainnet Launch**:
   - **Public Announcement**: Announce the full launch of the Flamma mainnet.
   - **Community Engagement**: Engage the community with launch events and activities to promote network adoption.
   - **Ongoing Support**: Provide continuous support and updates to ensure the network’s stability and growth.

</Steps>

The Flamma Mainnet launch plan ensures a structured and strategic deployment through its Pre-Mainnet (Pre-MN), Initial Mainnet (I-MN), and Full Mainnet (F-MN) phases. Each phase focuses on critical aspects such as reward distribution, project deployment, and network operations to guarantee a successful and sustainable mainnet launch.



## What is Flamma Mainnet?
Flamma Mainnet is the primary network where the Flamma blockchain operates in a live, production environment. Unlike testnets, which are used for development and testing purposes, the mainnet is where real transactions occur, and real assets are transferred.

1. **Production Environment**

    - Flamma Mainnet is the live, operational network where real transactions and smart contracts are executed. It is the final stage where all functionalities of the Flamma blockchain are fully operational.

2. **EVM and Solidity**

    - Flamma supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling compatibility with existing Ethereum-based applications.

    - Developers can write smart contracts in Solidity, the most widely-used programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring easy migration and integration of decentralized applications.

3. **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**

    - Developers deploy and run their decentralized applications on the Flamma Mainnet, ensuring they are accessible to users in a production environment.

4. **Economic Activity**

    - Real economic activity takes place on the Flamma Mainnet. This includes transactions involving the native cryptocurrency, transfers of digital assets, and execution of smart contracts.

5. **Security**

    - The mainnet prioritizes security, utilizing robust consensus mechanisms to protect the network from attacks and ensure the integrity of transactions.

6. **Flamma Consensus**

    - Flamma Mainnet uses Proof of Stake (PoS) as its consensus mechanism. This means validators are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

    - Additionally, it implements Efficient Proof of Stake (EPoS) for rapid handshake logic, which enhances node communication efficiency.

7. **Interoperability**

    - Flamma Mainnet is designed to be interoperable with other blockchains, allowing for seamless cross-chain transactions and interactions.

8. **High Performance**

    - The network is optimized for high performance, capable of handling a large number of transactions per second to support various use cases, including finance, payments, and gaming.

9. **Developer and User Ecosystem**

    - It provides a rich ecosystem for developers to build and deploy applications, and for users to interact with these applications securely and efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Real Transactions:** All transactions on the Flamma Mainnet involve actual tokens and assets, making it critical for real-world use cases.

- **Smart Contract Execution:** Smart contracts deployed on the mainnet operate in a live environment, facilitating various automated processes and decentralized applications.

- **FLA Token Transfers:** The transfer of Flamma’s native tokens and other digital assets occurs on the mainnet, reflecting actual economic value.

- **Validator Participation:** Validators on the mainnet are incentivized to secure the network through staking, earning rewards for their participation and honest behavior.

Flamma Mainnet is the core network where the full capabilities of the Flamma blockchain are realized. It is where real transactions take place, smart contracts are executed, and economic activities are conducted securely. By using PoS and EPoS, Flamma ensures efficient and secure network operations, providing a reliable platform for developers and users.
