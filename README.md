| [Get $FLA Test Funds](https://flafaucet.dev/)     |  Get test tokens to use on the Flamma network for development and testing purposes.   |
| [Deploy with Remix IDE]() | Utilize the Remix Integrated Development Environment to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts effortlessly.  |
| [Create an ERC-20 Token (üõ©Ô∏èNo Code)](/pages/QuickDappDeploy/erc20.mdx) | how to implement a no-code deployment of an ERC20 token using Remix and OpenZeppelin.  |
| [Deploy an NFT Collection (üõ©Ô∏èNo Code)]() | Launch a collection of [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent unique digital assets.  |
| [Integrate a Wallet in Your Front-End Application]() | Integrating a cryptocurrency wallet into your front-end application allows users to interact directly with the Flamma network from your website.  |
| [ERC20 Token Claim Front-End Template]() | This front-end template allows users to claim their ERC20 tokens seamlessly. Built with modern web technologies, the template provides an intuitive and secure interface for interacting with smart contracts.  |

## Development Tools and EVM Compatibility

The Flamma Network fully supports all standard Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) development tools, making it easy for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on the network. This compatibility ensures that developers can leverage their existing knowledge and tools from the Ethereum ecosystem when working with Flamma.
